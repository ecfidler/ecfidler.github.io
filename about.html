                <li class='aboutBody'>Hi I'm Ethan and I am a Computer Science student in the University of Cincinnati class of 2023. I have programming experience in Python, C++, Javascript, HTML, CSS (god bless), Matlab and LabView.</li>
            <li class='aboutBody'>I figured I would take a minute to write a bio of some sort here, I really have no idea what's going on with this website except for that it looks amazing. While programming it I kept stopping and hitting the "?" over and over and just appreciating how pretty those colored div blocks in the background were. The best part is when all 3 blots collide and create a whiteish spot.</li>
            <li class='aboutBody'>Projects of mine include a discord.py bot and this website (lmao).</li>
            <li class='aboutBody'>In my free time I like to play Super Smash Bros and spend money on Keyboards (my current build is a jc65 with MOD-M switches).</li>
            <li class='aboutBody'>There's really not much else to say... I don't think anyone is going to read this far (most people will probably read this far because I literally wrote less than a paragraph but I'm just being pessimistic for the joke, which I'm now realizing has gone on too far and isn't that funny... Just go back to the main page already I'm terrible at meta jokes)</li>
            <li class='aboutBody name'><a style='color:whitesmoke; text-decoration:none' title='<â€”' href='index.html'>That was embarrasing Click here to return to the main page</a></li>
