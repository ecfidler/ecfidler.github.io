        <h2 class="color-text" id="CGoalsAnchor">Part 1: Content Creation</h2>
        <hr>
        <h3 class="color-text" id="CGoalsAnchor2">What people post on Campus</h3>
        <p>We found that people would put posters up anywhere where people would be walking through. Art exhibits existed almost exclusively in DAAP or the Library. A theme that we noticed was signs that directed you to an event or location.</p>
        <p>The main thing that is different about AR content is that it can be interactable much easier. Currently a content creator would need to post a QR code to add interactivity to just a poster. AR would allow interactivity to be baked into content like quick RSVPing to events and autometically adding them to a calendar.</p>

        <p>The interaction elicitation session was done on the pathfinding model from above. The user was informed that the model was a mockup of a phone screen that they were holding out infront of them. The user clicked on the buttons to nagivate through the menu, also they mentioned panning the camera to look around. On the map they used pinch/move gestures with two fingers to pan and zoom on the map. On the final screen where the path was laid out in front of them they moved the camera around to see the path ahead of them. These findings were translated into storyboard sketches for the theoretical design team.</p>

        <p>The interaction elicitation session was done on the panorama model from above. The user "Clicked" on the poster with their finger like they would a button. The user then attempted to drag around the poster by the top of the "window". They also tried to scale it using two-finger gestures. They finally closed it by clicking the x button in the top corner.</p>
